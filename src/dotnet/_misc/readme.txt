-----------------------------

You can grab the two dll's you need out of
    ...\RelationshipManager56\Turbo RM Source and Tests - VS2005\Relationship Manager Turbo\bin\Debug

Relationship Manager Interfaces.dll
Relationship Manager Turbo.dll

You can open the solution 
   Turbo RM Source and Tests - VS2005/Turbo RM Solution.sln
to compile and run one set of tests.

There are other projects in this zip which are boo unit tests and the boo implementation.  I'm going to organise and document it a bit better soon.
