# Boo for .NET is deprecated

## Boo

The [boo language](http://boo-language.github.io/) for .NET is now deprecated, however this implementation created a .net `.dll` that was usable by other .NET languages.  This dll is still in the project and presumably perfectly usable?, however the C# implementation is much faster because of a caching system.

- `relmgr_boo/` - old Boo .NET project from 2005 incl. dlls which still might work?
- `doc/example.md` an example of calling the boo dll from C#
- `doc/RM for .NET (Boo language).html` old scrappy doco
- `doc/Boo thoughts.htm` some old thoughts on Boo
